This is a recreation of the popular Doodle Jump endless platformer. I developed this project to focus on procedural generation (creating platforms infinitely), vertical scrolling mechanics, and gravity-based physics.
🎮 How to Play
Movement: Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys (or tilt/mouse) to move the character.
Objective: Jump from platform to platform to reach the highest score possible without falling off the bottom of the screen.
Power-ups: [Optional: Mention if you have springs, rockets, or jetpacks].
✨ Key Features
Infinite Platforms: New platforms are randomly generated as you climb higher.
Screen Wrapping: Moving off the left side of the screen makes the character reappear on the right.
High Score Tracker: Saves your best jump distance during the session.
Dynamic Physics: Smooth jumping and falling animations with realistic velocity.
